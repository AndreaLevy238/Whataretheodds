# Whataretheodds
This is an Android app based on the classic dare game entitled "What are the Odds." 
The game consists of three user inputs and a single output.
The user inputs an action, a probability, and a number.
The probability is a positive integer.
The number is an integer between 1 and the probability.
For example, if the probability is 100, the user may input an integer between 1 and 100. 
If the user tries a number greater than 100, the computer will alert the user that they put in an invalid number 
The computer will then will try to guess the number the user input.
If the computer is correct then, the user will be told to do the action.
Otherwise the computer will say that it did not correctly guess the user's answer.
